### Hello, my name is Cem, I am 31 years old, I am a single father and live with my daughter in our cozy home, which is enlivened by two playful cats. My life so far has been characterized by my passion for technology and my love for motorcycles.

### I originally completed my master's degree in automotive engineering with a focus on control and system electronics, as well as IT technician specializing in hardware technology. My skills in this field enabled me to work in renowned companies such as Ferrari & Rolls Royce. Unfortunately, two years ago I had to give up my beloved job as my health no longer allowed me to perform physically demanding work.

### Despite this challenge, I took the opportunity to discover a new passion: programming. I've been an enthusiastic gamer since I was a child, but the world of code has always been foreign to me. Now I am venturing into this fascinating dimension of technology.

### With my in-depth knowledge of hardware technology, I can repair, rebuild or create just about anything. Programming, however, was a completely unknown world for me until recently. But I am determined to fill this gap in my knowledge and have actively set about learning how to program.

### The decision to embark on this new path marks an exciting stage in my life. I look forward to sharing my experiences and expanding my skills. Who knows, maybe I'll discover as much enthusiasm in the world of code as I did in the world of motors and electronics.
